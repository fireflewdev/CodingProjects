Various Coding Projects
Developed by Viraj Kacker and Aniket Pant.
To-Do List:
 • Regression Calculator, given test points (Cartesian Coordinates), then use matplotlib/Numpy to graph points, 95%, and regression. then print all values in an organized way. R&D boutta be LIT
  •RSA/AES decrypter
  •Law of Sines, Law of Cosines, maybe use Tkinter and plot triangles in GUI
  •Project Euler
  •Optics/Astronomy/Thermo calculator. Make a list of topics to tackle, define different functions, make a GUI, go one by one.
